Ideas (with about 5 hours left until I go home!)
------------------------------------------------
[DONE] 120 mins  Make monsters fight back, to add danger/risk to game! Make it a timing game, where different monster types attack at different speeds? Player needs health! Player heals completely after completing each quest? Monster should show a health bar too, with later monsters taking more hits to kill (even with bigger sword)? 

One guy's ideas:
(easy to add - could have a line after each quest is done) Add funny text to add comedy to the spoof game.
(too hard) Have very realistic sfx and music to contrast against the pixel art.
(too hard/random?) Make a rock-paper-scissors fight mechanic to add gameplay.

60 mins?  Sound effects!

Game is not fun!!!

[Many hours]  1D movement is boring - turn this into 2D game? Might take a lot of time!

Polish the boring 1D game? What's the point?
